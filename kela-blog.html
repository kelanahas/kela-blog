        <h1>About Me:</h1>
          <p>My name is Kela, I'm in my mid 20's, and have decided I want to learn new skills and change my life direction! I am mostly a creative mind...I work with metal and craft jewelry. Turns out making a living from art is <span class="feel">very</span> unstable and hard to make a living from. I still love doing it, but I'm keeping it on the back burner for now. I love to cook and experiment with fermentation, and have recently been bitten by the travel bug!</p>

                    I am missing my brother Kai terribly! He is still traveling around in SE Asia...and here I am in the boring states because I SHOULD have bought a one-way ticket. We face-time a lot...in fact we just got off the phone now. He is in the Kuala Lumpur airport about to board to Vietnam. He told me that after he spends time in Vietnam he'd be on his way back home. After that we can devise a new travel plan together! Perhaps South America?</p>
                <p>This is us being cute in Pai, Thailand. It was super smoky from fires, hence the masks

                I need to start a go-fund-me page for my sweet baby dog, Lahey. He has recently torn BOTH of his cruciate ligaments in his back legs. I can't stand it knowing he is in so much pain and I just want to see him be able to run around and be healthy again. Surgery is unsuprisingly <span class="feels">very</span> expensive. 5 grand for each leg...oy vey. When I get the go-fund-me page up and spread the word, I'm sure people are going to want to help us out. How can someone say no to this cute literal angel of a pup?!
